# Donor-Prediction
The aim of this project is to derive actionable insight to support our client who is a national charitable
organization. Our client seeks to use the results of a previous postcard mail solicitation for donations to
improve outcome in the next campaign and also determine which of the individuals in their mailing
database have characteristics similar to the most profitable donors. By soliciting only these
people, our client can spend less money on the solicitation effort and more money on charitable
concerns.
* Two datasets have been provided:
  * A. Donor Raw Data: this is a historical data, containing previous donor details. Target B column,
      provides information whether they have donated in past campaign or not.
  * B. Prospective Donors: this is a list of new contact; your client is interested in reaching out to in
    the next campaign they intend to carry out soon.
